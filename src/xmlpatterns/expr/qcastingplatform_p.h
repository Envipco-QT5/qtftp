    /**
     * @short Provides casting functionality for classes, such as CastAs or NumberFN, which
     * needs to perform casting.
     *
     * Classes which need to perform casting can simply from this class and gain
     * access to casting functinality wrapped in a convenient way. At the center of this
     * class is the cast() function, which is used at runtime to perform the actual cast.
     *
     * The actual circumstances where casting is used, such as in the 'castable as'
     * expression or the <tt>fn:number()</tt> function, often have other things to handle as well,
     * error handling and cardinality checks for example. This class handles only casting
     * and leaves the other case-specific details to the sub-class such that this class only
     * do one thing well.
     *
     * This template class takes two parameters:
     * - TSubClass This should be the class inheriting from CastingPlatform.
     * - issueError if true, errors are issued via ReportContext, otherwise
     *   ValidationError instances are returned appropriately.
     *
     * The class inheriting CastingPlatform must implement the following function:
     * @code
     * ItemType::Ptr targetType() const
     * @endcode
     *
     * that returns the type that should be cast to. The type must be an AtomicType.
     * Typically, it is appropriate to declare this function @c inline.
     *
     * A sub-class calls prepareCasting() at compile time(such that CastingPlatform can attempt
     * to lookup the proper AtomicCaster) and then it simply uses the cast() function at runtime. The
     * function targetType() must be implemented such that CastingPlatform knows
     * what type it shall cast to.
     *
